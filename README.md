# CS470_Computer_Security
CS470 Computer Security Course at BYU Idaho

Most of the assignments in this course were 
saved within a UNIX server at the university. 
I have uploaded what I have saved on my local 
drive. This is probably an eighth of what I 
did for this course.

Syllabus reads:

By the end of this semester, you will be able to:

Explain the foundational principles of computer security
Identify vulnerabilities in code and know how to mitigate them
Assimilate data from a wide variety of sources for the purpose of 
understanding the security issues in a given domain. In short, 
develop research skills
Clearly explain highly technical issues in an understandable way
CS 470 is essentially a research class where you will develop the 
skills to become a security expert in whatever domain is important 
to you when you enter the work force
